                things as technology is ever changing everyday and there are new,
                things to learn. Technology is also about being creative at times there are lots of thing,you think
                about
                but there is no proper platform to try it out and let others contribute to it
                but with technology you will meet people with like minds and put ideas together to bring out your ideas.
